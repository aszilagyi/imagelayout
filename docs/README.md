This directory contains files to build the various forms of the
documentation. The Makefile builds `imagelayout.1` (man page format)
and `imagelayout.html` (html). `configoptions-dynalist.txt` is a file
exported from Dynalist, containing the description of configuration
options. `dynalist2md.py` converts the dynalist file to Markdown.

Python and pandoc are needed to build the documentation.
